<:Re:885213737420722186>All types of self advertising is prohibited, especially discord invite links which will result in a warning and a 1 day mute. Dm advertising without users consent will result in a permanent ban. This rule does not apply to <#769070240503431178>, however, Nsfw servers still go against the [Nsfw Rule](https://discord.com/channels/768927312178577449/769650299195359292/879469916019892264).]
