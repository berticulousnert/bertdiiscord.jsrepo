<:Re:885213737420722186>Informing other members about the rules and Mini-Middong are different. You are allowed to tell other users about the rules, but threatening about the consequences, without any information about which rule they're breaking, is called Mini-Modding, you will receive a 5 hour hardmute for breaking this rule.]
